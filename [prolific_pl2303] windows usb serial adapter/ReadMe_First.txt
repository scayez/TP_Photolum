For the ICUSB232C2:

If you are getting a code 10 error after installing these drivers its possible you have the Revision A version of this adapter which contains a Prolific chip that, unfortunately, doesn't support Windows 8, 8.1 and 10 anymore.

If this is the case please feel free to contact Startech.com tech support to get the unit swapped for the newwer Revision B model that does support these Operating Systems.
